## Recommended For

Purchasing tech products in Israel, especially custom-built desktop computers. Ivory (along with KSP) offers an interesting purchasing model where you consult with a sales assistant who helps you spec out a computer, then they assemble it for you - typically at no extra charge.

## Notes

- While hardware is generally more expensive in Israel than abroad, this custom-build service provides real value
- The assembled computer comes with a warranty
- My second desktop was built at Ivory and has been a fantastic machine (my first was from KSP - both excellent experiences)
- The consultation process allows for thoughtful component selection rather than being stuck with pre-configured options
