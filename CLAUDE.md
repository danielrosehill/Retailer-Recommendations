I created this repository to gather together in an unconventional way a list of recommendations for retailers. And based in Israel, which has a fairly small domestic market. Now and again I receive great customer service from a store. And I like to pass on the recommendations. I thought that this would be a useful way for batching together a few of those for people who are new to the country etcetera. 

I'll provide basic details and follow this template for converting them into documents (each recommendation timestamped and created within a category)

You can help me by converting these into more structures recommendation notes according to the following template. 

# Retailer 

## Recommended For 

{Why I recommend it}

## Website

Their website

## Notes 

If applicable, notes.
